When to use type casting can be answered by asking the following 2 questions:

Is it possible, depending on the value, that attempting to change the value's data type would throw an exception at run time?
Is it possible, depending on the value, that attempting to change the value's data type would result in a loss of information?


string -> int (not safe conversion)
int -> string (safe conversion)


The term "widening conversion" means that you're attempting to convert a value from a data type that could hold less information to a data type that can hold more information. In this case, a value stored in a variable of type int converted to a variable of type decimal, doesn't lose information.
