Here's a brief list of categories of these built-in methods so you can get an idea of what's possible.

Methods that add blank spaces for formatting purposes (PadLeft(), PadRight())
Methods that compare two strings or facilitate comparison (Trim(), TrimStart(), TrimEnd(), GetHashcode(), the Length property)
Methods that help you determine what's inside of a string, or even retrieve just a part of the string (Contains(), StartsWith(), EndsWith(), Substring())
Methods that change the content of the string by replacing, inserting, or removing parts (Replace(), Insert(), Remove())
Methods that turn a string into an array of strings or characters (Split(), ToCharArray())



What is an overloaded method?
In C#, an overloaded method is another version of a method with different or extra arguments that modify the functionality of the method slightly, as is the case with the overloaded version of the PadLeft() method.

You can also call a second overloaded version of the method and pass in whatever character you want to use instead of a space. In this case, you fill the extra space with the dash character.


Console.WriteLine(input.PadLeft(12, '-'));
 Console.WriteLine(input.PadRight(12, '-'));




I want to create an api that return markdown.
